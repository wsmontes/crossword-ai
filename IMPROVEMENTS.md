- **Consolidated secure storage**: Simplified API key encryption/decryption logic  
- **Unified notification system**: Replaced multiple notification implementations with centralized NotificationManager
- **Streamlined settings management**: Removed redundant API key handling code and debug logging

### 2. API Key Storage Issues Resolved
- **Simplified storage logic**: Removed over-complicated debug storage with DEBUG_STORAGE flags
- **Fixed race conditions**: Eliminated multiple save events causing conflicts
- **Enhanced security**: Improved browser-specific encryption key generation
- **Better error handling**: Added proper validation and fallback mechanisms
- **Cleaner UI feedback**: Simplified status indicators and save confirmations

### 3. AI Crossword Generation Enhancements
- **Improved prompts**: Enhanced prompt structure with clear JSON formatting requirements
- **Retry mechanism**: Added intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts)
- **Better error handling**: Specific error messages for different failure types
- **Language support**: Proper Portuguese/English prompt generation
- **Validation improvements**: Enhanced puzzle data validation with specific error messages
- **Connection recovery**: Automatic reconnection attempts when AI service becomes unavailable

### 4. Grid Adjustment and Responsiveness
- **Dynamic sizing**: Implemented responsive grid sizing based on viewport and puzzle dimensions
- **Resize observer**: Added automatic grid adjustment on window resize
- **Size classes**: Added small/medium/large CSS classes for different puzzle sizes
- **Optimal cell calculation**: Smart cell size calculation considering available space
- **Aspect ratio preservation**: Maintains proper grid proportions across different screen sizes

### 5. UX Standardization and Flexibility
- **Centralized notifications**: New NotificationManager with consistent styling and behavior
- **Enhanced notification features**: Close buttons, action buttons, loading states, and animations
- **Improved loading feedback**: Better progress indicators during AI generation
- **Responsive design**: Enhanced mobile and tablet support
- **Dark theme support**: Proper notification styling for dark mode
- **Accessibility improvements**: Better ARIA labels and screen reader support

## üöÄ New Features Added
